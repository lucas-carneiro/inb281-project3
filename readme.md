# FPS Game: Advanced Game Design Project 3

Game developed for the Advanced Game Design (INB281) class at QUT (Queensland University of Technology).

### Description:

Take some time to play around with the provided FPS base to get a feel for the gameplay elements. Examine the various player and enemy objects/scripts to better understand how they function together. Plan and design a conceptual model of the game you wish to make (concept art, pseudo code etc). Create an interesting FPS game environment, using but not limited to the following tools, objects and assets:
- Lights and Audio Sources
- Particle Systems (weapon effects, damage effects, powerups etc)
- Complex HUD/GUI elements (health, selected weapon,  ammunition, crosshairs etc)
- A FPS player character controller (provided)
- One or more enemy NPCs on different, longer patrol paths (provided)

##### Deliverable:
At the end of this activity it is expected that you have experimented with the software and your version of the game has the following elements:
- A Level Design that has a justified layout:
    - All aspects of design has a reason: design a layout for your FPS level, and explain why certain elements are included
- (DONE) A combat system:
    - (DONE) The player and enemies have a total amount of health
    - (DONE) The player and enemies take damage per bullet hit
    - (DONE) The player and enemies die upon losing all health
- (DONE) Player “Health Bar” or “Hit Points” displayed on the player’s HUD
- Audio for death and bullet hits
- Background music
- New enemies spawn and patrol dependent on your level design

##### Suggestions (non-deliverable but useful):

    Enemy damage- The player can currently shoot and kill the barrels. However, the enemy and player cannot currently hurt one another.

    New Unitynavigation (A*) systemsetup/deconstruction

    Main menu and in-game pause menu with onGUI/new Unity GUI system
        New UI System
        Legacy GUI System-Manual

    Complex AI - Advanced FSM usage (please talk to your tutors for ideas on this)

    Additional weapons - Deconstruct how the current weapon is set up (scripts, hinge, animations etc) and see if you can implement your own
